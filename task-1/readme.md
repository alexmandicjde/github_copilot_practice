# Task: Set Up Node.js Project and Implement & Test Methods using GitHub Copilot

## Objective

The goal of this task is to familiarize you with the features of GitHub Copilot by setting up a Node.js project, implementing a set of methods in a JavaScript class skeleton, and validating them through unit tests using Mocha and Chai.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Clone the pre-prepared repository containing only the `AdvancedOperations.js` and `tests/test.js` files:
    - Repository URL: [Insert your repository URL here]

    **Terminal Command**:
    ```bash
    git clone [Repository URL]
    cd [Repository Directory]
    ```

### Step 2: Initialize the Node.js Project
1. **Initialize a Node.js project**:
    - Ask GitHub Copilot how to initialize a new Node.js project:

### Step 3: Install Necessary Packages
1. **Install Mocha and Chai for testing**:
    - Use GitHub Copilot to understand what packages must be installed and install them:

### Step 4: Implement Methods in AdvancedOperations Class
1. Open `src/AdvancedOperations.js` and implement the methods using GitHub Copilot assistance (both CodeWhisperer and Copilot assitant features).

### Step 5: Run Your Tests
1. Run your tests to validate the implementation:
    - Ask via GitHub Copilot chat on how to run the tests an run them

### Step 6: Troubleshooting
1. Utilize GitHub copilot In case of some of the tests failed and find a solution how to fix i


## Additional Notes:
- Use GitHub Copilot for assistance at each step.
- Review and understand the generated code.
- Run your tests frequently to validate each implementation step.
- Ensure that all tests pass before completion.
